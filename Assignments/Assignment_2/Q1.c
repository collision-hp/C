
It make code easier to understand, maintain, and modify: 
    1.Code_readability
        The goto statement can make code difficult to read and 
        understand. The non-linear control flow can make it hard 
        to follow the program's logic. 
    2.Code_maintainability
        The goto statement can make code difficult to maintain 
        and modify in the future. 
    3.Structured control flow
        Structured control flow constructs like loops and 
        conditionals are generally advised.
